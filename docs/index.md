## Problem:

Online marketplaces for used cars provide sellers with a platform to list their vehicles but fall short in guiding them through one of the most critical steps: **pricing their cars effectively**. 

Key issues include:

- **Lack of Pricing Guidance**: Sellers often rely on guesswork or incomplete research to set their prices.  
- **Missed Opportunities**: Overpriced cars deter buyers, while underpriced cars reduce seller earnings.  
- **Inefficient Process**: Without data-backed tools, pricing becomes a source of stress and uncertainty.

The result? A frustrating experience for sellers and suboptimal outcomes for online marketplaces.
